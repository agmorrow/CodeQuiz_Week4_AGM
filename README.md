# About this project: I was given the task to create a timed multiple-choice quiz that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. When the user clicks start, a timer starts and they are presented with a question. If they answer incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock. When the game is over The user can save their initials and score. There is also a high score board where users can see the high scores from past users.
# Built With HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
